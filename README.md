## Requirements
You will need a Red5 Pro server (either hosted or local) to connect the client. Also required is a Red5 Pro Mobile SDK License Key. If you already have a Red5 Pro account, you can download the server and find your license key at [Accounts](https://account.red5pro.com). If not, you will need to sign up for a new account.
 
### Mobile SDK Setup
* Copy your key into the `<license_key>` property field of the `app/src/res/raw/test.xml` resource file.
* Also modify the `<host>` value in `app/src/res/main/raw/test.xml` to point to your server address.
* If running the server locally, your machine and mobile device need to be on the same Wi-Fi network.

Once you have modified your settings, you can run the application on a device.

## Notes

1. You will need two devices, a publisher and a subscriber, for some examples. Also, some require another mobile device, but most can also use the [HTML5 Testbed Examples](https://github.com/red5pro/streaming-html5).
2. You can see a list of active streams by navigating to http://your_red5_pro_server_ip:5080/live/streams.jsp
3. Click on the flash link (for example, flash_publisher) in the streams list displayed to view the published stream in your browser.
